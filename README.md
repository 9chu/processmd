Process a directory of markdown and yaml files to JSON files. This project uses [mkdirp](#/) to replicate the folder structure of it's source. It has many options for customizing the output. It also has the option of converting yaml and markdown to json and then the converted json back to the source files. It uses yargs, globby, js-yaml, and marked**.

## Roadmap

- Maybe add an option to not write files?
